# Audio-Cleaner-for-After-Effects
🎧 Audio Cleaner for Adobe After Effects A customizable silence remover script panel made for editors, voice-over artists, and anyone tired of trimming quiet parts manually.

🧠 What Is This?
Audio Cleaner is a dockable ScriptUI panel for Adobe After Effects that scans your audio layer and automatically trims your video/still layer based on volume. Perfect for cleaning interviews, voiceovers, tutorials, and more.

This tool was built by experimenting with existing ideas and workflows — and adding my own twist with a user-friendly UI and flexible controls. The goal was to make something simple, fast, and useful.

✨ Features
🔇 Silence Detection: Identifies quiet parts of your audio layer

🎚️ Adjustable Threshold: Decide what’s “too quiet”

🧈 Audio Padding: Add buffer frames around cuts for smoother edits

🔄 Flexible Modes:

Remove silence (ripple-delete)

Keep only silence

Leave gaps but still trim

🖼️ Dockable Panel UI: Clean layout, easy to use inside AE
